# Bank Management System

## Introduction
The **Bank Management System** is a Java-based application developed using Swing for the user interface and JDBC for database connectivity. It provides basic banking functionalities such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance enquiry, and generating mini statements. This project is designed as part of an academic submission to demonstrate core concepts of Java programming and database handling.

## Objectives
- To simulate real-world banking operations using Java.
- To provide a simple and user-friendly interface for transactions.
- To implement database connectivity using JDBC.
- To demonstrate the use of Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Features
- Account creation and login
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Fast cash option
- Balance enquiry
- Mini statement generation
- Pin change

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **GUI Framework:** Swing  
- **Database Connectivity:** JDBC  
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **IDE Used:** IntelliJ IDEA
